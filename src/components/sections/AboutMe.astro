      I build practical, user focused products powered by clean workflows, strong systems thinking and applied AI.
      My work lives at the point where product, engineering and customer experience meet. I take unclear,
      messy and operationally heavy problems and convert them into structured solutions that scale.
      <br /><br />
      I started working early in life and grew through hands on experience instead of traditional titles.
      That background made me very good at understanding users, spotting patterns, simplifying complex processes
      and solving problems with speed. Over the years, this turned into a unique blend of product instinct,
      technical clarity and execution discipline.
      <br /><br />
      At Freightify, I built AI agents, automation systems and analytical tools that improved support efficiency and
      shaped product decisions for global freight networks. At NAVTOR, I am driving technical solutions for maritime
      systems, building AI support tooling and creating the entire Digital Logbook SharePoint knowledge architecture
      that acts as the single source of truth for product, engineering and support teams.
      <br /><br />
      My strengths include:

      I care about building products that remove friction, reduce cognitive load and create clarity for users.
      My approach combines product thinking, technical depth, process understanding and a strong ability to
      automate repetitive work using AI. Outside of work, I explore consumer behavior, experiment with new ideas
      and keep myself updated on the latest developments in AI, product design and systems thinking.
